Once the vehicle is delivered, it disappears from the team's view to avoid any confusion. We utilized technologies such as PostgreSQL, ReactJS for the frontend, and Go for the backend, focusing on applying solid principles to achieve a scalable project. Currently, we are working towards implementing a clean architecture to further enhance the system.    During the development of CarService, I learned to design a complete web application from scratch, using modern technologies like ReactJS and Go. I gained experience in handling the interaction between the frontend and backend, implementing functionalities such as user registration, appointment requests, and vehicle status tracking. Additionally, I acquired knowledge about relational databases, utilizing PostgreSQL to store and manage information effectively.

        lyrics: "In the Macla Bakery project, I had the opportunity to develop the front-end using Styled Components. Styled Components is a React library that allows writing CSS styles directly in the application's components. This provides greater modularity and facilitates the reusability of styles. I used Styled Components to create custom styles and ensure that the bakery's website looks appealing and consistent across all devices. It was exciting to work with this tool and enhance my skills in user interface development.",
