I gained experience in handling the interaction between the frontend and backend, implementing functionalities such as user registration, appointment requests, and vehicle status tracking. Additionally, I acquired knowledge about relational databases, utilizing PostgreSQL to store and manage information effectively.

        lyrics: "One of my first projects was developing a Todo Web App using ReactJS. It was a great learning experience where I gained proficiency in state management, working with hooks, and creating reusable components. This app has been extremely useful for organizing my daily programming tasks, as I can add, track progress, and mark completed tasks. At the end of the day, I can review what I've accomplished and feel a sense of productivity and achievement.",
